# Breast-cancer-image-processing-classification
This project aims to develop a breast cancer detection system using image processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The pipeline involves preprocessing mammogram images to enhance features relevant to cancerous tissue, followed by training a CNN model to classify the images as malignant or benign.
